One of the reasons why I wrote this article is my, rather unusual, encounter with a missing message body writer in a Jersey 1 test application.

In this article I’d like to explain two things. First, what to do when you want to restrict JAX-RS providers to be used on, for example, client-side only. And second, what are the issues (and how to solve them) with injecting providers when you create and register instances of them directly.

Yesterday, the Jersey team has released Jersey 2.0-m05. The theme of the scrum sprint was to integrate Jersey 2.0 into the development trunk of GlassFish and switch core Jersey code to the latest JAX-RS API which contains significant changes in message filtering API. I am happy to report that we succeeded in delivering both main goals. [&#8230;]

Yesterday I gave a talk at Devoxx on what&#8217;s coming in JAX-RS 2.0 that is planned to go final in the middle of the 2012. On the stage it was hard to see the people because of the spot lights beaming at me, however I could notice that the cinema room for about 450 people [&#8230;]
